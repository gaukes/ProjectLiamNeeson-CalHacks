# Squirrel

Squirrel was made during CalHacks 2015 by Ted Xiao, Nick Xu, and Gautham Kesineni.  Squirrel is a free application to help you painlessly invest and give back, whenever you spend money. The application is called Squirrel because squirrels are cute animals that eat <a href="https://www.acorns.com/">acorns</a> and because squirreling means stashing something away for use later. We hope you find this project useful!

Note: The project demo is currently NOT hooked up to real data, because the project uses the Capital One Hackathon API, which does send real data.
